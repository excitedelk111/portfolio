            I don't like using labels to put myself (and others) in tiny boxes
            that cannot even begin to describe who we are, but if I had to pick
            a few to describe my role in the projects I have worked on, I think
            that "Developer, Designer, Engineer, and Thinker" would do the best
            job. I will now try my best to summarize my journey in a way that
            captures what I believe in, stand for and am passionate about.
            <br />
            <br />
            The one thing that separates us, from every other living creature,
            is creativity and original thought. It is integral to who we are and
            to bringing us satisfaction from the work we do, but how does one
            attempt to understand a concept that is so uniquely human? I tried
            my hand at everything from Sports to Math to Molecular Biology to
            Religion. I didn't know exactly what I was searching for but I knew
            it had to do with finding satisfaction in the work I do and finding
            something I am passionate about that epitomizes creativity and
            original thought. This search followed me as I started college, and
            at the end of my first year, I felt like technology and software
            were the avenues I was looking for.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ability to create, to make something and be able to share it
            with the world. The ability to transcend what's right in front of
            us, to be able to find our way through an ever expanding sea of
            analysis, opinions and ideas and truly change a mind or situation
            for the better. The ability to create something tangible, something
            that can impact people's lives, from nothing, excited me unlike
            anything I had done so far.
            <br />
            <br />
            I think technology and software are wonderful because it is a tool
            with which we can create something that can impact the greatest
            number of people in the shortest amount of time - the much coveted
            top-left corner of the impact-effort matrix. I hope that my
            experiences and education will better inform my ability to build
            products and organizations that solve problems, help people and make
            a difference.
            <br />
            <br />

            Outside my professional work experience, academically, some of the
            advanced coursework I've taken, in areas I'm particularly interested
            in, include

            (in no particular order). I am also concurrently pursuing a Master's
            Degree, which I hope to graduate with alongside my Bachelor's
            Degree, and part of that endeavour involves writing a thesis that I
            am working on with
