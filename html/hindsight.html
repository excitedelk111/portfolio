            March 2020: Brown announces that they will be closing for the rest
            of the semester because of the novel coronavirus. I am an
            international student, and all my American friends were heading back
            home, and I had to decide if I should fly back to India or continue
            to stay at Brown. I eventually decided to fly back, but that is not
            the decision I will be analyzing today. Instead, it’s the decision I
            had to take nearly a year later – whether or not I would come back
            to the US for the Spring semester.
            <br />
            <br />
            December 2020: At this point, I had already spent nearly a year at
            home, and it’s not that I don’t love home or staying with family,
            but I missed my friends, many of whom I had grown extremely close to
            during my time at Brown. I also felt like I had already missed out
            on over ¼th of my college experience and did not want to miss out on
            more. Lastly, the near 11-hour time difference between India and the
            east coast meant staying up till 5 AM was now normal, but certainly
            not healthy.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the other hand, coming back to the US would be expensive (flight
            tickets, health insurance, rent etc.), and travelling meant I could
            potentially get COVID. This would normally not be a problem since I
            am young and would just quarantine. However, I have asthma, and
            COVID being a respiratory infection, meant that it had a much higher
            chance of becoming more than just a simple fever and cough for me. I
            eventually decided to fly back to the US, and I am currently at an
            Airbnb in Columbus, Ohio having a great semester (all things
            considered) with three of my closest friends.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first factor that made me consider not making this trip was that
            it would be significantly more expensive than if I just decided to
            do the semester remotely from home. These would be the approximate
            costs I would incur if I decided to come back: Flight Tickets
            ($2000), Health Insurance ($2500), Rent ($3000), Food ($2000),
            Miscellaneous ($1000). That’s nearly $10000 (give or take) – which
            is a lot of money. Since I decided to come back, I obviously
            convinced myself that this cost was worth it, and I think there are
            two psychological theories/hypotheses that explain how I justified
            this cost.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first is a combination of anchoring and adjustment and the way I
            framed the situation for myself. Yes, $10000 is a lot of money when
            thought of as an absolute value independent of what it is being used
            for. However, if I valued my education at nearly $50000/year or
            $200000 in total, then $10000 is a seemingly marginal cost – just 5%
            of what I am totally spending on my education – when framed this way
            it doesn’t seem nearly as bad. I also think that $200000 acted as an
            anchor for what would be reasonable to spend on this “adventure” –
            it made the $10000 seem like a justifiable expense.
            <br />
            <br />
            Second, I think that mental accounting played a significant part. I
            had spent nearly $60000 on my first year at Brown, while I had only
            spent $15000, so far, on my second year at Brown (since I had just
            paid the tuition fee for the fall semester). So, in my mind, it
            seemed reasonable to spend another $25000 on the spring semester
            ($15000 for tuition + $10000 for the rest) because it would bring
            the total to $40000 for the second year, which is $20000 less than
            what I spent the previous year.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to which, I had secured an internship over the summer
            that was paying me almost $30000 and so I didn’t feel nearly as
            guilty about asking my parents to help me pay for this, since in my
            mental account, I used this $30000 to compensate for the second
            year’s costs bringing the effective cost for my second year down to
            $10000 compared to $60000 for my first year.
            <br />
            <br />
            Coming to the second issue, which was in some ways, the more
            concerning one – my health. I knew that there was a good chance I
            could get COVID when travelling, and I think the best way to explain
            why this did not concern me as much as it should have, is the
            availability heuristic. I did not know anyone my age who had
            personally been infected I knew of one person with diabetes (one of
            the worst co-morbidities) who was infected and was totally okay. My
            asthma had never caused me any serious health concerns before this.
            I had friends who had flown back and forth to the US multiple times
            and not gotten infected.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thus, from an availability perspective, it did not seem like I would
            ever get COVID (provided I took the necessary precautions), and even
            if I did, the consequences did not seem too bad, or at least they
            paled in comparison to what a seemingly normal semester would look
            like for me. Lastly, I know we tend to be risk-seeking in the domain
            of losses, and that clearly played a part here as well – I was
            willing to “take the gamble.”
            <br />
            <br />
            To conclude, anchoring and adjustment, mental accounting, the
            availability heuristic and being risk-seeking in the domain of
            losses (the framing effect) certainly tricked me into thinking that
            the cons of this decision were not really “cons” - $10000 is a large
            amount of money (no matter what the circumstances are), and if I had
            gotten COVID, I could have permanently damaged my (already weakened)
            lungs. However, I think if I viewed this as a multi attribute
            decision and for example, used WADD, then I still would have made
            the same choice, because the memories I have made and will continue
            to make, and the friends and relationships I build now, will likely
            last me a lifetime – and if I realistically weighed the attributes
            involved in this decision, the weight of this single positive
            attribute would be sufficient to overcome the other negatively
            weighted attributes.
