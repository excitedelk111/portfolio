          <h3>An Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The Indus Valley Civilization lasted from about 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE
            and flourished between 2600 BCE and 1900 BCE. The region had five
            major urban centers or cities (> 80 Ha), all of which grew to
            considerable size and prominence over a relatively short period
            between 2600 BCE and 2500 BCE. I intend to primarily focus my
            investigations both on this period of development and subsequent
            years of flourishment. I will also focus on two of these five major
            cities, Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before elaborating further on the specific reasons this region stood
            out to me, I must acknowledge that of equal importance, but not
            personal interest, is the rest of the region (and most of the
            population) that lived in smaller settlements (< 40 Ha) interspersed
            between the five major cities. This civilization was vast and
            spanned an area stretching from today’s northeastern Afghanistan,
            through much of Pakistan, and into western and northwestern India
            (Wright, 2009).
            <br />
            <br />
            Naturally, the question arises, why would I have titled this page
            “Short Essays On The Indus Valley Civilization” when I just stated
            that I am only going to be focusing on Mohenjo Daro and Harappa,
            moreover, why would I choose to limit myself to just two cities
            given how large the civilization is. This is primarily because the
            rural context remains a poorly understood component of the
            civilization (Singh et al., 2009), both due to lack of remaining
            material culture and also due to the Indus Valley script not being
            decipherable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now that I have addressed perhaps the most obvious question, I will
            move on to the more interesting one. The first reason I wanted to
            focus on these cities was that they were noted for their
            particularly sophisticated urban planning, baked brick houses,
            elaborate plumbing and drainage systems, indoor toilets, water
            supply systems, and new techniques in handicraft and metallurgy
            (Wright, 2009). The civilization developed concurrently with ancient
            Egypt and Mesopotamia but was not just larger than the other two but
            also more advanced.
            <br />
            <br />
            The second reason is the similarities in sophistication, city plan,
            construction materials (same type and shape of brick), and
            construction period between Mohenjo Daro and Harappa that seem to
            indicate that they had to be part of a unified government with
            extreme organization (Babul). However, at the same time, there is no
            overt evidence of prominent individuals from burials, sculptural
            traditions, or elite structures. This overlaps with unresolved
            questions about the nature of Indus elites, whether a ruling class
            dominated Indus cities, and whether there was significant monumental
            public architecture in the form of major religious buildings or
            palaces (Kenoyer, 2010). The lack of palatial or religious
            structures (Chakrabarti, 2008) and relatively uniform architecture
            (EORC) indicate that people were, for the most part, considered
            equals. This was especially intriguing to me because almost all
            ancient civilizations were the exact opposite. These facts also
            seemed to contradict each other as the cities were built quickly in
            a highly organized and advanced manner, yet all the people were
            equals and there was seemingly no clear power structure that could
            have organized this? It didn’t make sense.
            <br />
            <br />
            The third and final reason was the lack of clear fortification and
            war preparedness. This furthers the argument that there were no
            clear power structures and that people lived as equals yet does
            nothing to explain the rapid construction of uniformly advanced
            cities spanning across a vast region. The cities did contain some
            minimal fortification; however, this was primarily near the
            “Citadel” where the Great Granary and Bath were found, not
            facilities of war (EORC). There is some evidence of knives, spears,
            and arrowheads, however, it is unclear if the weapons were used for
            protection against animals or for warfare (Babul). This seeming lack
            of war preparedness is also made further confusing by the fact that
            there is evidence of strong and consistent trade with Mesopotamia
            and the Persian Gulf area i.e., they were aware of potential
            “enemies” and conflicts, yet didn’t take any steps to protect
            themselves? Once again, it doesn’t make sense.
            <br />
            <br />
            These facts are naturally intriguing, and our comprehension of these
            factors is irrevocably hampered by the fact that we are unable to
            decipher the script that might provide insight into the daily lives
            and practices of the people. However, I think it should be
            interesting for these very same reasons and I look forward to
            exploring these themes further, but I am also equally prepared to
            come to the conclusion that all we can do is speculate and that many
            of these interesting questions will remain unanswered.

          <h3>The Foundations</h3>
          <p>
            With this essay I hope to explore what it meant for Mohenjo Daro to
            be considered one of the most advanced cities of its time with
            remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning
            (Wright, 2009). With that said, let’s jump right into it. The city
            could be split into two sections, a so-called upper acropolis or
            citadel and a lower city.
            <br />
            <br />
            The citadel was built on the highest part of the city, likely to
            show the importance and status of buildings in that region. These
            buildings were largely for public use and were impressive from an
            architectural point of view. They were very well-planned with
            precise measurements and ratios. Some of the interesting ones are
            the so-called Granary and College. The Granary is impressive not
            because it is believed to have stored grain but because very few
            bronze-age cities in Eurasia had large storage structures like
            these; and the College because it is believed to be one of the
            earliest public educational institutions.
            <br />
            <br />
            While the citadel was objectively impressive and probably meant to
            be a display of power and progress, the lower city primarily
            consisted of densely constructed rectilinear residential buildings
            on a grid plan (Pant and Fumo, 2005), with each block containing a
            network of houses and public wells. The lower city also featured
            urban elements such as roads that met at perfect right angles,
            hundreds of public wells, fire pits, and kilns, and were primarily
            functional in purpose rather than aesthetic (Iyengar, 2008).
            Evidence also shows that the Indus culture lacked magnificent
            buildings and on the contrary, most buildings were large-scale
            public buildings, commodious houses, or practical residences (Green,
            2021).
            <br />
            <br />
            As briefly mentioned previously, the citadel was built on the
            highest part of the city, this was not just for symbolic reasons but
            also to combat flooding from the Indus River. Walls were built
            around the entire city (with additional strength and thickness
            around the citadel), potentially to indicate combat strength and act
            as fortification but it was most likely to prevent flooding
            especially because there is evidence of tapering at the bottom of
            the walls to guide water away from the city.
            <br />
            <br />
            The last notable feature of Harappan architecture, that I may
            explore in a subsequent essay in more detail, is that of a highly
            developed and sophisticated water and waste management system with
            hundreds of public wells extremely well integrated into the city.
            Experts acknowledge that even with today’s technology, this must
            have required advanced planning to implement, and it turns out that
            the city’s sewage, plumbing, and drainage systems were in fact
            distributed in the city grid plan by early hydro-engineers (Khan,
            2020).
            <br />
            <br />
            It clearly seems like Mohenjo Daro has the rightful title of one of
            the most advanced cities of its time, but this presses the question
            of how the civilization managed to achieve such sophistication
            without any clear hierarchical power structure and apparent equality
            of all its citizens. This question also intrigued me when I wrote
            the prior essay but only intrigues me more now.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the sake of brevity, I won’t get into too much detail, but I
            think it will be interesting to consider the views of Massimo Vidale
            and Adam Green on this topic. What makes their arguments especially
            interesting is that they try to explain how the civilization managed
            to achieve such sophistication by exclusively investigating its
            architecture and planning i.e., conclusions are derived from what
            exists and not through speculation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Vidale presents an argument for the presence of palace-like
            architecture supporting the argument that the Indus Civilization was
            headed by elites settled in individual, citadel-like walled
            enclosures competing for political supremacy (Vidale, 2010). This
            offers a simple and rational explanation to a natural question that
            is now no longer intriguing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Green on the other hand, presents an argument for concepts of
            heterarchy, and collective action, offering potential explanations
            for how early state societies may have established high degrees of
            civic coordination in the absence of exclusionary political
            strategies or dominant centralized political hierarchies (Green,
            2018). Since Green’s work was written in 2018, it is quite carefully
            constructed to make their point despite the evidence Vidale brings
            up. Green further backs up their argument with a more recent paper
            in 2021 where they argue that this was the first complex ancient
            society based on egalitarianism.
            <br />
            <br />
            I may end up exploring these ideas in further detail in a future
            essay, and with that “cliffhanger,” I will conclude.

          <h3>Water Management</h3>
          <p>
            This topic is particularly interesting because their water
            management system was more advanced than those of other
            civilizations prospering at the time and in many ways, resembles
            systems we have today. Ancient water management systems broadly seem
            to be influenced by three factors. The first is the region having
            too much water, which meant they had to protect themselves from it.
            The second is if it did not have much water at all, which meant they
            had to ensure they have enough to survive. The third is that of
            convenience and luxury, which influenced how the system was
            implemented. The Indus Valley’s system seems to be influenced by all
            three factors. The first two are naturally a result of the climate
            of the region, so we will start our discussion there.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are two theories about climate in the region. According to the
            first theory, it used to be cold, wet, and rainy. In addition to
            which, there were constant floods during heavy rains and especially
            during snowmelt in the spring as the region is bounded by the
            Himalayas to the North. The livelihood of many people in the region
            depended on agriculture which in turn depended on these sources of
            water. The second theory says that the region experienced arid
            continental climate with hot long summers and short winters just
            like the climate of the region today (Hasan and Khan, 2010). This is
            supported by the fact that baked bricks were only used for
            construction on the riverbanks and not used in areas away from the
            river.
            <br />
            <br />
            I personally think the two are not mutually exclusive. The Indus
            Valley Civilization was vast, and it makes perfect sense for cities
            like Mohenjo Daro close to the Indus River to have experienced
            conditions described by the first theory while cities like Dholavira
            that were much further inland, away from the river, and closer to
            the Thar desert, to have faced conditions described by the second
            theory.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let’s first focus on Mohenjo Daro. As a result of its proximity to
            the Indus River, there was a constant risk of flooding; houses were
            built on plinths that rose above the street level with stairs
            recessed at the wall at the front door to avoid flooding (Khan,
            2004). Most important buildings were situated on significantly
            higher ground in the Citadel (Nambiar, 2006) for the same reason.
            The city walls also show evidence of tapering at the bottom to guide
            water away from the city.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to these protective measures, the town planners of
            Mohenjo Daro had also built the world’s first known drainage system.
            It was a central system that connected every household in the city
            and consisted of elaborate brick-lined channels for the removal of
            rainwater. Drains in the streets carried water from the city into
            the aforementioned covered channels that ran along the centers of
            the city's main streets into nearby agricultural fields, rivers, or
            streams. The entire system is of unparalleled engineering skill
            (Rothermund and Kulke, 1998). It’s important to note that this
            system also served as the sewage system and helped with waste
            management. I elaborate on this in my subsequent and final essay.
            <br />
            <br />
            The last point I will touch on is the influence of convenience and
            luxury. They were known for their obsession with water (Jansen,
            1989), and were masters at constructing wells. It is estimated that
            about 700 wells were built within the city, an average of one well
            for every third house, and the bigger houses had their own wells
            (Jones, 1967). These wells were constructed with tapering bricks
            that were strong enough to last for centuries (Ann, 2009).
            <br />
            <br />
            Before moving onto Dholavira, let’s briefly explore the region’s
            irrigation systems. These systems had to be robust because, as
            previously mentioned, large scale agriculture was practiced as
            livelihood by many in the region; and they had developed an
            extensive network of canals for their irrigation needs. It was
            reasonably sophisticated and in practice was very similar to the
            canal systems developed in southern Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley
            canals were also supported by large reservoirs, such as the ones
            built at Girnar (Shirsath, 2009).
            <br />
            <br />
            While there were strict public maintenance rules for canals in
            Mesopotamia and less strict but still community-based maintenance
            systems in later civilizations like Rome, it’s not clear how any of
            the water management systems (including the irrigation system) in
            the Indus Valley region, were constructed or maintained. The
            standardized nature of the systems as well as provisions for regular
            inspection of drains seem to indicate that it was maintained by
            authorities, but as I’ve previously mentioned, authority and
            governance structures are a major point of contention in this
            region. Given how important water is to the functioning of any
            society (including our own today), it once again begs the question
            of whether such organized use of irrigation and water management
            systems allowed centralized authority to rise or if centralized
            authority was necessary to organize such systems in the first place
            – certainly interesting to think about, but somewhat vain to discuss
            due to the lack of evidence to support either argument.
            <br />
            <br />
            Getting back to our primary discussion, now moving onto Dholavira.
            Given its location in present day Rann of Kutch, a salt marsh in the
            Thar desert, and the ensuing climate of the region, it was necessary
            to collect and store water for various purposes. The Archaeological
            Survey of India has revealed that one third of the area of the city
            was devoted to collection and distribution of fresh water. So, it’s
            clear that this was very important to them, but how exactly did they
            use all that space?
            <br />
            <br />
            They had a sophisticated water conservation system of channels and
            reservoirs, the earliest found anywhere in the world. Massive
            reservoirs situated around the metropolis were fortified with
            stonewalls and were used for storing freshwater brought by rains and
            water diverted from two nearby rivulets. There were sixteen or more
            such reservoirs of varying size. Like the Nabateans in Petra that we
            discussed in class, a lot of these channels and reservoirs took
            advantage of the natural environment, specifically the slope of the
            ground within the large settlement, a drop of 13m from northeast to
            northwest.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to these massive reservoirs, there were several wells
            and tanks. Many tanks were cut directly into rock to provide
            drinking water to tradesmen who used to travel along the trade
            route. Each local settlement in the area had its own water
            harvesting and storage system in the form of rock-cut cisterns,
            ponds, tanks and wells, some of which are still in use today. This
            is once again a reflection of the priority placed on water by the
            civilization, the so-called “convenience and luxury” factor I
            previously mentioned.
            <br />
            <br />
            I think this quote summarizes the thoughts of most scholars of the
            region, reflects why the Harrapans’ water management systems were
            worth discussing, and is a perfect way to conclude, "The kind of
            efficient system the Harappans of Dholavira developed for
            conservation, harvesting and storage of water speaks eloquently
            about their advanced hydraulic engineering, given the state of
            technology at the time" (Subramanian, 2010).

          <h3>Waste and Sanitation</h3>
          <p>
            The way a civilization treats waste and sanitation is a direct
            reflection of how civilized they are. This is a strong claim and
            should intuitively make sense but let me elaborate. The quality of
            systems to deal with waste and sanitation are directly proportional
            to public health outcomes, and the value a society places on human
            life is directly proportional to how civilized they are. For those
            still skeptical, simply consider exactly why we strive to advance
            the field of medicine, why life expectancy is an indicator of
            developed countries, and most recently, why we “stopped” the world
            and decided to wear masks, but didn’t in 1918, at least not to the
            extent we did in 2020.

            <br />
            <br />
            Further, more advanced waste management and sanitation systems allow
            a society to support and sustain larger populations, as was the case
            with the Indus Valley Civilization. More recent and concrete
            examples of why this is important are illustrated by the challenges
            that London and New York faced with rising populations, just at a
            much larger scale than the Indus Valley Civilization. In London,
            with increasing urbanization of the population in the nineteenth
            century, filthy environmental conditions became common in working
            class areas, and the spread of disease became rampant. Smallpox,
            cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis reached unprecedented levels. It
            was estimated that nearly 10% of the population died of smallpox,
            and more than half the working class died before their fifth
            birthday. In New York, as late as 1865, filth and garbage
            accumulated in the streets to a depth of two or three feet; as a
            result of which, spread of diseases was rampant and child mortality
            rates were at all-time highs.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is all relevant to highlight the importance of waste management
            and sanitation, as well as why Mohenjo Daro’s system was especially
            impressive and a reflection of the advancement of their society.
            Mohenjo Daro presents a picture of a community in which both
            personal and community cleanliness was effectively practiced, and
            the water supply reasonably safeguarded from contamination. This was
            possible because early engineers created sophisticated plumbing and
            sewage systems that were well integrated into city plans. These
            systems could rival any urban drainage systems built before the 19th
            century (Khan et al., 2020), and meant that most people lived a
            luxurious life with proper sanitation (Saleem, 2012).
            <br />
            <br />
            Practically every house in Mohenjo Daro had its own bathroom
            (Mulchandani and Shukla, 2010), always placed on the street side of
            the building for convenient disposal of wastewater into street
            drains; these drains are the same ones that feed into the
            centralized drainage system briefly discussed in the previous essay.
            The drains were usually 46 to 61 cm below street level and varied in
            depth and width from 23cm to 30cm (Gray, 1940). When the drain could
            not be covered by flat bricks, or stone slabs, the roof of the drain
            was corbelled.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the bathroom, people stood on a brick “shower tray” with raised
            edges and tipped water over themselves from a jar. The clean water
            came from a well as nearly all houses had excellent plumbing
            facilities for provision of water (Rothermund and Kulke, 1998); and
            as previously mentioned, the wastewater drained through a terracotta
            pipe out through the wall into the drain on the street (Lofrano and
            Brown, 2010).
            <br />
            <br />
            Latrines were also commonly found inside houses and were once again,
            placed on the street wall for the same reason as the bathrooms;
            what’s also interesting is that latrines were placed immediately
            adjacent to the bathrooms, exactly like we do today in the modern
            world, and for the same reason – ease of plumbing. The latrines were
            designed exactly like modern day western-style toilets, made from
            bricks with wooden seats on top and were flushed with water from
            jars (Hooper, 2011). There were also instances of bathrooms and
            latrines located on the upper floors of larger buildings, and they
            were drained by vertical terracotta pipes with closely fitting
            spigot joints, set in the building wall.
            <br />
            <br />
            The centralized drainage system briefly discussed in the prior
            essay, and something I promised to elaborate on, is an engineering
            marvel in and of itself. It connected every household in the city
            and consisted of waterproof brick-lined channels that ran along the
            centers of the city's main streets carrying water and waste from the
            city into closed seeps or directly out of the city (Jansen, 1985).
            In order to prevent the drains from clogging up, a wooden screen at
            the end of the drains held back solid waste. The drains had
            inspection holes to regularly check on the status of the drains and
            had movable stone slabs for maintenance. The liquid wastes either
            went straight out of the city or entered a cesspool made of radial
            bricks. These cesspools were regularly cleaned out.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the impressive sewage system, it appears that houses
            also had trash chutes built into the walls, sometimes even
            descending from upper floors, at the foot of which there were bins
            at the street level. It’s speculated that those who cleaned the
            drains and cesspools were also responsible for clearing trash from
            the bins on the sides of houses (Khan, 2004). Public trash bins were
            also provided at convenient places (Gray, 1940). This sort of system
            is very familiar to us today in the modern world.
            <br />
            <br />
            Speaking of public trash bins, public toilets were also present
            despite the extensive private toilet system. These were primarily
            found in government buildings and multiple dwelling houses which
            ranged from single to several stories with many rooms, public baths,
            common wells, and sanitation facilities (Kuthiala, 2009). These
            facilities were maintained extremely well; this is not much of a
            surprise given their society’s emphasis on sanitation and hygiene,
            but this is unlike most public toilets, be it Vespasianae from the
            past or even today, where there is a sense of disgust with the poor
            maintenance, vandalism and lack of basic facilities (Pathak, 1995).

            <br />
            <br />
            Concluding with what I started off with, I think there is something
            to be said for the fact that in other contemporaneous civilizations,
            skills of the artist and builder were lavished upon temples, palaces
            and homes of the elite while the homes of the common man were
            inadequate and could be considered ephemeral hovels. It’s clear that
            there was something different about the priorities of the people of
            the Indus Valley and I think it is extremely interesting to see
            people today advocating for that same equity, just differently, with
            things like universal basic income, and equitable housing and
            healthcare. Maybe history does repeat itself.
