          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This essay will provide a brief analysis of what the Search for
            Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) means, what it is motivated by,
            what it entails, and what its chances of success are. It starts off
            by delving into a discussion about the first question by providing
            summaries of prominent views on the definitions of life and
            intelligence while simultaneously justifying why the search for
            intelligence is more appealing than that for life. After arriving at
            a reasonable consensus, our motivations for exploring the universe
            and searching for extraterrestrial intelligence are discussed
            &ndash; both philosophical and logical arguments are presented
            alongside rationale for why this search isn&rsquo;t a wild goose
            chase. Lastly, the paper concludes with a presentation of 3 of the
            primary approaches used to search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
            appropriately balancing justifications for such approaches and
            details on the techniques themselves. A consistent theme of the
            essay will be to justify the rationality of this endeavor thereby
            providing sufficient intuition for the readers themselves to think
            about the last explicitly unanswered question &ndash; what are our
            chances of success with this search?
          </p>
          <h3>Some Basic Definitions</h3>
          <h4>Defining Life</h4>
          <p>
            As we start exploring what the search for extraterrestrial
            intelligence means, naturally, a few fundamental questions arise.
            <em
              >How do we define extraterrestrial intelligence? Does intelligence
              necessarily require life? If so, how do we define life?</em
            >
            Let&rsquo;s start by exploring our definition of life. While this
            may seem like a philosophical question, it is one that has more
            recently been explored in excessive detail by astrobiologists as the
            need to provide a clear definition for life has taken on increasing
            significance in recent years. Relevant to our context is the fact
            that as we explore more of our solar system and the galaxy, we will
            encounter extraterrestrial systems that may resemble life and we
            will need to determine if the system satisfies a set of properties
            that fall within an accepted definition of life. As may be apparent,
            this is a hard question to answer, so I will simply provide an
            overview of some of the most prominent views on this topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deamer<sup>5</sup> suggests stating a minimal set of properties
            associated with the living state, that, taken together, exclude
            anything that is not alive. With Deamer&rsquo;s<sup>5</sup> list of
            properties we run into a classical issue with a strict definition of
            life which is that there are often robust counterexamples and when
            properties are excluded one at a time, the definition becomes
            exponentially weaker. The following simple example illustrates this.
            Suppose a system reproduced perfectly so that evolution could not
            occur, let&rsquo;s assume this meets our definition of life.
            Consider another system in which all the nutrients required for
            growth were present in the medium so that no metabolism was
            required, let&rsquo;s assume this does not meet our definition of
            life. Viruses, have no metabolism &ndash; they require the cytoplasm
            of cells to survive &ndash; however, they can also evolve, so are
            they life or not?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Tirard<sup>16</sup>, Morange<sup>16</sup> and
            Lazcano<sup>16</sup>
            suggest that while phenomenological characterizations of life are
            feasible, a precise definition of life remains an elusive
            intellectual endeavor. They claim that instead of viewing life vs
            non-life as a discrete distinction, the emergence of life be seen as
            the stepwise (but not necessarily slow) evolutionary transition
            between the non-living and the living &ndash; so, it would be
            meaningless to draw a strict line between them, especially without
            any context of the environment in which they evolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bedau<sup>2</sup> bridges the gap between these views stating that
            we can attribute a significant part of the controversy over the
            definition of life to the use of a Cartesian approach to explaining
            life, which seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for being an
            individual living organism, out of the context of other organisms
            and the abiotic environment. He takes on an Aristotelian approach to
            defining life, not philosophically, but through the
            Program-Metabolism-Container (PMC) which provides a definition for
            minimal chemical life &ndash; explaining eight of life&apos;s
            hallmarks, one of life&apos;s borderline cases (the virus), and two
            of life&apos;s puzzles. These papers were written in 2010 and were
            the primary ones analyzed as they were present in NASA&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;Defining Life: A Collection of Essays&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <p>
            A far more recent paper from Bartlett<sup>1</sup> and
            Wong<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>proposes an interesting term
            &ldquo;lyfe&rdquo; with four classifying standards (dissipation,
            autocatalysis, homeostasis, and learning) instead of the traditional
            eight (homeostasis, organization, metabolism, growth, adaption,
            response to stimuli, and reproduction). Their goal was to solve
            current controversies on the definition of life and broaden our
            criteria for life-search on other planets. Peer reviews seem to
            suggest that while their analysis is far-sighted and insightful in
            some ways, it is seemingly just a summary of the classical
            definition of life; and the authors agree, stating that their intent
            was to come up with a generalized framework that would not fall prey
            to the often-robust counterexamples that break all prior definitions
            of life. This paper, however, is very recent and requires deeper
            review.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I will stop here since this is not the primary focus of this essay
            but simply serves to illustrate the complexity of defining life, and
            thus, the search for it. It is also meant to serve as a precursor to
            why attempting to define intelligence and searching for intelligence
            instead of life may be a more appealing endeavor.
          </p>
          <h4>Defining Intelligence</h4>
          <p>
            We can now explore the more relevant and interesting questions posed
            at the start of this section.
            <em
              >How do we define extraterrestrial intelligence? Does intelligence
              necessarily require life?</em
            >
            Let&rsquo;s start by exploring our definition of intelligence, and
            for the moment, just assume that intelligence does not necessarily
            require life &ndash; exactly why will become clearer as we explore
            our definition of intelligence. &nbsp;Conventionally,
            extraterrestrial intelligence is often conflated with the concept of
            sapience i.e., extraterrestrial life with human-like abilities. An
            alternative and also often cited definition is that of sentience,
            which requires intelligence but not life, yet in my opinion, this is
            still a far too complex definition of intelligence for our purposes;
            or more accurately, we are not really searching for intelligence
            itself but rather for signs of intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any observation in the universe that appears unnatural may be
            considered a sign of preliminary intelligence &ndash; I say
            preliminary because it may appear unnatural to us but could end up
            being a natural occurrence &ndash; just one we have not previously
            encountered (as we realized was the case with pulsars). It is
            important to note that we are only assuming that searching for any
            unnatural occurrences in the universe and using those as signs of
            intelligence is a reasonable way to search for extraterrestrial
            intelligence; and the reason we can make this assumption is because
            we can make fairly accurate distinctions between the naturally
            occurring and not. I say this because in as much of our galaxy and
            the universe that we have explored we have not found a single
            chemical element we have not previously identified, including in
            galaxies that are not our own.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide a more concrete example to drive my point home, say we
            identify a metal object with a very specific geometric pattern (a
            hypothetical intergalactic communication beacon) that is the sole
            unnatural object on an otherwise uninhabitable planet &ndash; we
            have most certainly detected the presence of an extraterrestrial
            intelligence &ndash; but we have done so not through detecting life
            or life with intelligence but rather through a sign of intelligence.
            While I couldn&rsquo;t find a paper that explicitly defined
            extraterrestrial intelligence or the search for it in the way I
            summarized above, most prominent papers, including Sagan<sup
              >14</sup
            >
            and Drake&rsquo;s<sup>14</sup> famous
            <em>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&nbsp;</em>and
            Cocconi<sup>21</sup> and Morrison&rsquo;s<sup>21</sup>
            <em>Searching for Interstellar Communications&nbsp;</em>allude to
            the fact that they define extraterrestrial intelligence this
            way.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Since this is not a comprehensive analysis on the definition of
            extraterrestrial intelligence, let&rsquo;s conclude this discussion
            by assuming we have a reliable definition of extraterrestrial
            intelligence (or at least whatever it is that we are looking for)
            i.e., we will know when we have found &ldquo;it&rdquo; and we will
            &ldquo;all&rdquo; agree on it. Like I alluded to previously,
            defining intelligence (or signs of intelligence) was a far easier
            task than doing so for life, and assuming that&nbsp;intelligence
            does not require life does not invalidate our search for
            intelligence, it only makes it easier.
          </p>
          <h3>Our Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            Now we can move onto the second of four primary questions I wanted
            to explore.
            <em
              >What motivates our search for extraterrestrial
              intelligence?&nbsp;</em
            >There is a philosophical motivation which is that we seem to care
            enough about our place in the hierarchy of all intelligent beings to
            share knowledge about ourselves with others and to hope that others
            (if they exist) would want to do the same. I made a subtle
            assumption when I said &ldquo;all intelligent beings&rdquo; &ndash;
            I assumed that there are others out there &ndash; to skeptics, and
            quite frankly, most people, this may seem like an outlandish
            assumption. This is almost certainly because they don&rsquo;t truly
            understand the scale involved when talking about things in the
            universe &ndash; both in terms of space and time. So, I will now
            provide some empirical evidence to both provide context for those
            who don&rsquo;t have any and to justify why this assumption, is in
            fact, rational.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The sun formed 10 billion years ago, life on Earth started 3.5
            billion years ago, <em>homo sapiens&nbsp;</em>arrived 300,000 years
            ago, humans left the first recorded signs of abstract and symbolic
            thought 40,000 years ago and signs of intelligence, at the very
            earliest, have been detectable (from space) for the last century or
            so. It is clear that despite the apparent 3.5 billion years it took
            for intelligence (and technology) to arrive on Earth (after life
            first emerged) there are obvious selective advantages to it, at
            least up to the present evolutionary stage when technology also
            brings the threats of ecological catastrophes, the exhaustion of
            natural resources and nuclear war. Barring such disasters, we can
            reasonably expect that humans will remain on the earth for at least
            millions, if not billions of years and considering the exponential
            technological progress in the last century, it would no longer seem
            illogical to consider technological advancements capable of allowing
            interstellar communication and/or travel in the near future (a few
            thousand years, maybe less). In addition to which, we know that
            there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone (and 200 billion
            galaxies in the universe), and at least one planet for every star
            i.e., there are at least 100 billion planets in our galaxy. These
            facts alone should make our search for intelligence seem
            rational.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we can take this a step further, let&rsquo;s assume the
            probability of life is very low and that the number of individual
            steps required for the evolution of intelligence and technology so
            large and improbable that not all inhabited planets evolve technical
            civilizations, and even if it were highly likely that civilizations
            tended to destroy themselves at about our level of technological
            development, the number of technological civilizations in the galaxy
            today would still be very large.&nbsp;Sagan<sup>14</sup> and
            Drake<sup>14</sup> estimate there being around a million
            civilizations (0.001% of all planets) in our galaxy at or beyond the
            earth&apos;s present level of technological development. Even a
            skeptic would agree that there is a possibility that 0.01% of
            Sagan<sup>14</sup> and Drake&rsquo;s<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>estimation
            i.e., 100 civilizations (0.00001% of all planets), may be a rational
            estimate, and (at least) I believe that if there are 100 intelligent
            civilizations out there (in our galaxy alone), then it is certainly
            worth looking for them. I hope I have managed to convince you, with
            this brief argument, that this is not a wild goose chase and is in
            fact a rational effort.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To get back to our motivation, my initial philosophical argument
            stands, but if one wants to take a more concrete stance, consider
            that of Jill Tarter who says that at least part of our motivation
            should be that it is almost certain that any intelligence we come
            into contact with will be far more advanced than us and if we can
            convince them to travel to us, we should do so, and if they are able
            to, then they probably have everything they need in their own galaxy
            so they would only come to help us, and we need the help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I conclude this discussion, as an aside, I must acknowledge
            Fermi&rsquo;s Paradox &ndash; the apparent contradiction between
            high estimates of the probability of the existence of
            extraterrestrial civilizations and humanity&rsquo;s lack of contact
            with, or evidence for, such civilizations. I will point out that
            considering the size of the universe, 100 (civilizations)
            isn&rsquo;t a high number so we shouldn&rsquo;t expect to have found
            even 1 in such a short period of time. In addition, the great filter
            hypothesis<sup>18</sup>, the rare earth hypothesis<sup>19</sup>, and
            the zoo hypothesis<sup>20</sup> are just few of many possible
            explanations for the lack of evidence (we have been able to gather)
            for extraterrestrial life/intelligence.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <h3>The Search</h3>
          <p>
            Now that we have established exactly what we are searching for and
            why we would be searching for it, we get to the questions of how we
            are conducting this search and what our chances of success could be.
            I will briefly touch on 3 of the primary methods we use to search
            for extraterrestrial intelligence today. The first is detection of
            radio signatures, the second is detection of techno signatures and
            lastly, I will briefly touch on search techniques based on some
            purely hypothetical theories (Kardashev scale, Dyson spheres and
            Shkadov thrusters).
          </p>
          <h4>Radio Signatures</h4>
          <p>
            The detection of radio signatures has been, by far, the longest
            continuous effort and the one we have invested the most resources
            into. Cocconi<sup>21</sup> and Morrison&rsquo;s<sup>21</sup> classic
            <em>Searching for Interstellar Communications&nbsp;</em>written in
            1959 makes a strong case for the detection of radio signatures and
            Sagan<sup>14</sup> and Drake&rsquo;s<sup>14</sup> equally famous
            <em>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&nbsp;</em>nearly 40
            years later in 1997, does the same again. So,
            <em
              >why do we expect there to be interstellar radio
              signatures?&nbsp;</em
            >Given the vast distances between planets in the universe, any
            communication would happen only between very long-lived and patient
            civilizations. For some context, if we make&nbsp;Sagan<sup>14</sup>
            and Drake&rsquo;s<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>assumption of there being a
            million civilizations in our galaxy at or beyond the earth&apos;s
            present level of technological development and if we assume these
            civilizations are distributed randomly throughout space then the
            distance between us and the nearest civilization should be about 300
            light-years. So, any information conveyed between the nearest
            civilization and our own will take a minimum of 300 years for a
            one-way trip and 600 years for a question and a response (another
            argument against Fermi&rsquo;s Paradox since we&rsquo;ve only had
            radio technology for about half a century). In view of these facts,
            which should be common to and deducible by all intelligent
            civilizations in our galaxy, it seems quite likely that one-way
            radio messages are being beamed at the earth at this moment.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The prior argument assumes that most other civilizations are at
            around the same level of technological development as we are.
            However, this is almost certainly not the case since we have
            only&nbsp;achieved the capability for interstellar radio
            communication in the past few decades, it is almost certain that any
            civilization we encounter will be far more advanced than us. If this
            is the case, then it may be reasonable to expect that to an advanced
            extraterrestrial civilization that is surveying the galaxy for signs
            of life, at some point in time, the Sun, and its planets (or at
            least two of them &ndash; Earth and Mars), would have met the
            criterion for harboring life. It is reasonable to make this
            assumption because even our &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; technology would
            be capable of telling us this if we were in another star system and
            were looking at the solar system. So, a more advanced civilization
            can be expected to know at least this much if not much more. In
            expectation of the development of life and intelligence on one of
            these planets, it is highly likely that any extraterrestrial
            civilization would set up a channel of communication that we would
            one day discover. Ordinarily, what I just said would seem like
            science-fiction, yet I hope by this point, it does not, but rather
            seems perfectly rational.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve tried my best to make a convincing argument for why we
            should be searching for interstellar radio signatures, but really,
            I&rsquo;ve just been making an argument for why we should be
            searching for interstellar communications.
            <em
              >Why radio signatures? Why not some other means of
              communication?</em
            >
            The answer is actually quite simple, interstellar communication
            across the galactic plasma without dispersion in direction and
            flight-time is practical and financially feasible only with
            electromagnetic radiation. Interstellar space vehicles cannot be
            excluded a priori, but in nearly all cases (no matter the extent of
            technological advancement) they would be a slower, more expensive,
            and more difficult means of communication. This argument is further
            bolstered by the fact that any civilization, no matter where it
            exists, must contend with the same laws of physics, astronomy, and
            radio technology that we do &ndash; so they too must come to the
            same conclusions as us.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we have convinced ourselves that searching for radio
            signatures is a rational and promising means of detecting
            extraterrestrial intelligence we must still guess or deduce the
            frequency at which the signal is being sent, the width of the
            frequency band, the type of modulation and the star transmitting the
            message.&nbsp;Cocconi<sup>21</sup> and
            Morrison<sup>21&nbsp;</sup>make an argument for searching at
            the&nbsp;frequency of the spin-flip transition of hydrogen at 1,420
            megahertz, while&nbsp;Sagan<sup>14</sup> and
            Drake<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>say that such a channel may be too noisy for
            communication precisely because hydrogen, the most abundant
            interstellar gas, absorbs and emits radiation at that frequency. The
            truth is that the number of other plausible and available
            communication channels is not large since most of the astronomical
            radio spectrum is quite noisy, so deducing the right one should not
            be too difficult, and we&rsquo;ve probably got hundreds, if not
            thousands of scientists and engineers working on this every time we
            launch multi-billion dollar telescopes.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This is only a brief overview of radio signature detection and
            instead of getting into the technical details of exactly how we do
            this, I felt it was more important to explain why doing so made
            sense in the first place. For the sake of brevity, I will conclude
            here, but as with most things in this essay, this topic alone could
            be explored as a separate book.
          </p>
          <h4>Techno Signatures</h4>
          <p>
            The search for techno signatures is a far more recent endeavor
            &ndash; one that we have not invested too many resources into and
            also one that is a little more nebulously defined than the search
            for radio signatures. First, let&rsquo;s define a techno signature.
            In essence, it is any measurable property or effect that provides
            scientific evidence of past or present technology. This is very
            closely related to my argument for how we should be defining
            extraterrestrial intelligence in the first place. Some examples of
            techno signatures include radiation leakage from mega scale
            astroengineering structures such as Dyson spheres, artificial light
            pollution from an extraterrestrial ecumenopolis (an entire planet
            that is a single city), or Shkadov thrusters (stellar engines that
            harness a star&rsquo;s energy for interstellar travel). I will first
            focus specifically on the detection of atmospheric pollution and
            artificial heat/light pollution as potential techno signatures. As I
            stated earlier, I will touch on Dyson spheres and Shkadov thrusters
            in the following section on search techniques based on some purely
            hypothetical theories.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Lin<sup>22</sup>, Abad<sup>22</sup>, and Loeb<sup>22</sup> make a
            case for why the detection of industrial pollution serves as a
            chemical signature of intelligent life. Their paper focuses on
            harnessing the abilities of the soon-to-be launched James Webb Space
            Telescope which will give us unprecedented insights into the
            atmospheres of exoplanets similar (in size and proximity to the host
            star) to Earth by allowing us to compare a star&rsquo;s spectrum
            as-is to when an exoplanet transits in front of the star allowing us
            to see absorption lines corresponding to the planet&rsquo;s
            atmosphere. They decide to specifically focus on 2 CFCs &ndash;
            CCl<sub>3</sub>F (trichlorofluoromethane) and CF<sub>4</sub>
            (tetrafluoromethane) despite methane and nitrous oxide, which are
            also byproducts of industrialization, being easier to detect. This
            is primarily because methane and nitrous oxide are not as
            exclusively anthropogenic as CFCs. Since CFCs are harder to detect,
            we can only detect very high levels (much higher than the levels of
            such pollutants on Earth). The authors found that ~1.2 days of total
            integration time will be needed to detect ~10 times the amount of
            CCl<sub>3</sub>F and ~1.7 days to detect ~10 times the amount of
            CF<sub>4</sub> as there is on Earth.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 2 caveats to using this method of detection. The first is
            that since these pollutants have very long lifespans,
            CF<sub>4</sub>, for example, has a half-life of around 50,000 years,
            if an exoplanet&rsquo;s atmosphere showed high levels of these
            pollutants without signs of shorter-lived biomarkers, we might have
            evidence that an intelligent civilization once resided on that
            planet but does not anymore. It is quite ironic that one of the
            worst-case scenarios for pollution in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere makes
            for the best-case scenario for atmospheric detection of an alien
            civilization. The second is that the telescope exposure times needed
            to detect these industrial pollutants are much greater than what it
            will take to find water vapor, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and
            other basic indicators of unintelligent life. However, if we first
            detect water vapor, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other
            basic biomarkers including methane and nitrous oxide, they can give
            us a hint as to whether industrial pollution may be present. If
            these biomarkers and pollution indicators are found, it may be worth
            the extra time to determine levels of CFCs. This longer timeframe
            needed to detect CFCs also allows for detecting additional
            biomarkers like the chlorophyll &ldquo;red edge&rdquo;. This paper,
            of course, is offering a very specific approach to detecting
            intelligent life via industrial pollution, but it is the only one
            grounded in facts and with a concrete plan as to how it can be
            performed.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            There are, however, 2 drawbacks to this approach. The first being
            that we are now looking for intelligent life and not just signs of
            intelligence (which certainly narrows our chances of positive
            detection) and the second that there is always a possibility of
            misdetection; for example, the atmosphere of Titan (Saturn&rsquo;s
            largest satellite) has detectable signatures of complex chemicals
            that are similar to industrial pollutants, though certainly not the
            byproduct of civilization. It may seem like the argument for
            detecting industrial pollution as a techno signature is quite weak,
            but it turns out that it is even weaker for artificial heat/light
            pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the detection of artificial heat/light pollution,
            Avi Loeb and Edwin Turner have proposed that artificial light from
            extraterrestrial planets, such as that originating from cities,
            industries, and transport networks, could be detected and signal the
            presence of an advanced civilization. This assumes that the radiant
            energy generated by a civilization would be relatively clustered and
            can therefore be detected easily.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this is not necessarily the case. We need a way of showing
            that light and heat detected from planets can be distinguished from
            natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of intelligent
            life. This may turn out to be harder than expected as NASA&apos;s
            2012 Black Marble experiment showed that significant stable light
            and heat sources on Earth turn out to be naturally occurring and
            originating from uninhabited areas &ndash; chronic wildfires in arid
            Western Australia was one such spot identified by this mission.
            Clearly, the detection of artificial heat/light pollution is a far
            less conclusive means of detecting intelligence than industrial
            pollution and also has the same drawback which is that we are now
            looking for intelligent life and not just signs of intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Searching for techno signatures is certainly interesting and is a
            step in the right direction but it should be clear that our approach
            needs to be refined to search for signs of intelligence (and not
            intelligent life) and we need to come up with more concrete ways of
            doing so &ndash; right now, it is far too nebulous and loosely
            defined to justify investing significant resources into it. Once
            again, this is a new and burgeoning means to detecting intelligence
            and I can&rsquo;t even get close to doing it justice with what I
            have said here but it should serve to at least provide a brief
            introduction to the space and some justification as to why radio
            signatures are still our best bet.
          </p>
          <h4>Kardashev Scale, Dyson Spheres and Shkadov Thrusters</h4>
          <p>
            To conclude this discussion, let&rsquo;s briefly touch on some
            search techniques based on purely hypothetical theories &ndash;
            simply because they are interesting. The Kardashev<sup>23</sup>
            scale was first put forth in 1964 and classified all civilizations
            as Type I, II or III (it has since been expanded to include types IV
            and V). Type I civilizations can harness all the resources of their
            home planet (1016 &ndash; 1017 W), Type II civilizations can harness
            all the energy from their star (4 x 10&shy;26 W) and Type III
            civilizations can harness all the resources of their galaxy (4 x
            1037 W). At its simplest level this is what the classification means
            but it is also meant to serve as a measure of intelligence as
            measured by transmission of information. For some context as to
            where we stand, Sagan introduced a continuous Kardashev scale in
            1973 where a value was assigned to a civilization based on the
            amount of energy they consumed and Earth&rsquo;s energy consumption
            in 2008 gave us a score of 0.7 &ndash; so we&rsquo;ve got some
            progress to make before we even get classified as Type I. The
            Kardashev scale actually gives us context when discussing Freeman
            Dyson&rsquo;s<sup>24</sup> ideas in his famous paper
            <em>Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation</em>
            which was interestingly, independent of Kardashev&rsquo;s ideas,
            published earlier, in 1960.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dyson believed that if extraterrestrial intelligence exists and has
            reached a high level of technical development, at a certain point
            (as they transition from Type I to II), they will construct a
            hypothetical megastructure or swarm of satellites that completely
            encompasses a star and manages to capture most of its energy. This
            structure is called a Dyson sphere/swarm. If such structures
            existed, they could affect the characteristics of their host
            stars/galaxies. Some of the possible techno signatures of such
            astroengineering projects include reduced optical luminosity,
            boosted infrared luminosity and morphological anomalies. Dyson
            specifically focused on the infrared radiation, but later
            reserach<sup>25</sup>
            explores some of the other effects by investigating predicted
            offsets of such galaxies/stars from the optical Tully-Fisher
            relation.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To some, this may seem completely like science fiction, maybe even
            so far as to feel insulted that it was mentioned in this essay, and
            such a sentiment may be valid for Shkadov thrusters but they are
            analyzed regardless, simply because, at least I, think they&rsquo;re
            quite cool; but getting back to why Dyson spheres made it in here,
            it&rsquo;s primarily because we have a scientifically sound way of
            detecting them and a clean Dyson sphere identification would be (one
            of very few) undeniable signatures for intelligence. So, searches
            for Dyson spheres have been conducted &ndash; the IRAS infrared
            satellite covered 96% of the sky up to a distance of 300pc and found
            a few (16) ambiguous but interesting candidates over a million
            surveyed stars. So, Dyson spheres may not be as fictional as they
            may sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like I previously said, Shkadov thrusters may sound a little too
            fictional, regardless, they too are theorized as an indication of a
            Type II civilization. They are a Class A stellar engine. These
            engines are stellar propulsion systems, consisting of an enormous
            mirror or light sail which would balance gravitational attraction
            towards and radiation pressure away from the star. Since the
            radiation pressure of the star would now be asymmetrical, the excess
            radiation pressure acts as net thrust accelerating the star. Such
            thrust and acceleration would be extremely small, but such a system
            could be stable for millennia and any planetary system attached to
            the star would be dragged along by its parent star. Class B stellar
            engines are essentially Dyson spheres i.e., they are only used as an
            energy source and do not generate thrust. Class C stellar engines
            also known as the Badescu-Cathcart engine combines the other two
            classes of engines employing both the propulsive aspects of the
            Shkadov thruster, and the energy generating aspects of a Dyson
            sphere. This type of engine would be extremely unstable though it
            would generate far more thrust than a Class A engine. Once again,
            these stellar engines would tend to have similar observable effects
            on their host galaxy/star as that of Dyson spheres with the added
            observational effect of seeing entire systems of stars and planets
            moving noticeably through space.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we keep exploring (and extending) such ideas any further we will
            quickly start descending into what I would now consider undeniably
            science fiction territory, though who am I to say, given I&rsquo;ve
            been trying to convince you all along that the search for
            extraterrestrial intelligence is in fact rational and something we
            must devote resources to. The only question I posed that I
            haven&rsquo;t explicitly explored is an evaluation of our chances of
            finding extraterrestrial intelligence, but I think I&rsquo;ve
            provided sufficient intuition for thinking about that throughout the
            paper.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            To conclude, let&rsquo;s assume we find an extraterrestrial
            intelligence. What happens next? Will history repeat itself like the
            Columbian exchange? This is exactly the question that
            Kwon<sup>10</sup>, Bercovici<sup>10</sup>, Cunningham<sup>10</sup>,
            and Varnum<sup>10</sup> explored and found an answer to. Their work
            suggests that our reactions to a future confirmed discovery of
            extraterrestrial life/intelligence are likely to be fairly positive,
            and on that note, I will end my discussion with a brief summary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The paper started off by presenting a variety of different views on
            how life may be defined only to conclude that it is a very complex
            process and one that is not especially relevant to this essay.
            However, it was primarily meant to make the case for why defining
            intelligence and searching for intelligence instead of life may be a
            more appealing endeavor. We then proceeded to define intelligence
            and through this process highlight the fact that for the purposes of
            SETI, intelligence really just means a sign of intelligence, which
            may be defined as any unnatural observation in the universe. Once a
            reasonable definition for what SETI meant had been established, the
            paper moved onto exploring our motivation to search for an
            extraterrestrial intelligence. Starting off with a philosophical
            argument, then briefly pausing to understand the scale, both in
            terms of space and time, of the universe and why that meant SETI was
            a perfectly rational endeavor and concluding with a more logical
            (albeit a little somber) argument, contrasting the initial
            philosophical one.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, we had established exactly what we were searching for
            and why we would be searching for it. So, it was time to move onto
            how we were doing this. This last section of the essay focused
            specifically on 3 of the primary approaches we take to search for
            extraterrestrial intelligence. Starting off with radio signatures,
            that are, by far, the most scientifically sound and concentrated
            effort we have made &ndash; the rationale for this is pulled from
            some of the most famous SETI papers while technical details are
            largely excluded for the sake of brevity. We then move onto techno
            signatures, two approaches are explored in reasonable depth, but the
            conclusion is clear &ndash; these approaches are not as mature as
            they need to be to justify investing billions of dollars into.
            Lastly, there is a brief segment on some of the most famous
            hypothetical theories and how we may identify extraterrestrial
            intelligences on the basis of those theories. With that, I hope this
            essay served its primary purpose which was to provide a brief
            analysis on what the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)
            is, what it is motivated by, what it entails, and what its chances
            of success are.
