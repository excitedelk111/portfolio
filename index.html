                    This article walks you through the process of analyzing and
                    identifying usability flaws in an existing interface,
                    creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for
                    various screen sizes, and building a responsive website
                    based on those prototypes. I wanted to pick an interface
                    that I knew very well and used quite often so that the
                    effort I would be putting into redesigning it would be well
                    worth it and so that I had a sufficiently large dataset of
                    usability concerns that I could try to solve. So, I chose
                    Brown's Computer Science Concentration Requirements page.

                    This article walks you through the preparatory steps of
                    creating personas and storyboards including contextual
                    inquiries which involve observing real users interacting
                    with an interface and interviewing them about their
                    experiences. I will then use this information to develop two
                    personas as well as a storyboard for one of these personas.
                    I wanted to pick an interface that was in public view (i.e.,
                    so that other members of the public may see what is going
                    on) so as to not make those being observed feel
                    uncomfortable or surprised that someone could see what they
                    were doing. At the same time, I did not want to pick
                    something that only had very simple interactive components
                    like a faucet or door handle. So I decided to go with an
                    automated ordering kiosk at a cafe.

                    This article walks you through the process of designing an
                    interactive interface for an emerging startup when working
                    in a team. It will cover the full process of mocking up a
                    solution to the startup's concept. This process was roughly
                    split into four parts to exemplify an iterative design
                    process flow. The first was sketching ideas of the
                    interface, followed by creating an interactive,
                    high-fidelity prototype, then conducting user testing on a
                    final, revised prototype, and lastly contacting the startup
                    to show them the design we came up with. We wanted to pick a
                    startup that was doing something meaningful and since one of
                    our team members intends on becoming a doctor, we ended up
                    choosing NimbleRx.

                <p>
                  Over a 3 week period, we (a team of 3) worked through the
                  ideate, prototype, test and evolve phases of the design
                  process. We were provided with a PRD (Product Requirements
                  Document) by a consumer research firm. During our design
                  process, we produced 75+ sketches, 10+ low fidelity
                  prototypes, used multiple decision making frameworks, created
                  a BOM (Bill of Materials), FBD (Free Body Diagrams) for 2
                  different loads on the chair, detailed CAD models and
                  extensive FEA simulation in Fusion 360 to test the structural
                  rigidity of the chair. We concluded with a presentation to a
                  former senior executive of multiple Fortune 200 companies. A
                  more detailed article is coming soon!

                  Over a 5 week period, we (a team of 2) mentored by a designer
                  at Disney and guest lecturer at Stanford's d.school worked
                  through the entire design process as we re-imagined the UI and
                  UX of LMS software (Canvas). We first conducted user research
                  across several schools including Brown, MIT, CMU and Stanford,
                  and then synthesized that research to determine our project
                  goals. We then had multiple rounds of ideation, and during
                  prototyping, we created two iterations, conducting expert
                  critique sessions, think-a-loud sessions with users, and
                  iteration ranking surveys between the first and the second. We
                  concluded with a final working Figma prototype. A more
